## ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ JavaScript Keycodes

### ðŸŒŽ â†’ https://kingrayhan.github.io/keycode/

A simple webpage that responds to the key pressed and returns the JavaScript 'on-key pressed' keycode.

In JavaScript or jQuery you often need to find out which key was pressed. Unfortunately, we don't have it as easy as comparing it against a string like "esc" or "space bar". Each key on the keyboard is associated with a number, or what we call a keyCode and it is accessed on the event object. When I do keycode listening, I always scrounge the net for the appropriate keycode to check for. No more! I've made this project which does one thing well: tells you the asociated keycode and key when you tap any key on your keyboard.
